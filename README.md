# testTask1
Develop a project with the following description:
A list should be presented on the initial screen.
List item: picture + name + time in the format “day-month-year hours: minutes” (for example: 01-March-2016 10:10).
It is also necessary to make a field with a filter by the name of the list items.
We get the data by a GET request for this url: http://xxx/test.json.
By clicking on the list item, you go to another screen with its detailed description.
On this screen, it should be possible to scroll through the list items using the slide left-right.
Add menuItem to the Navigation project with 2 groups (they do not perform any actions when activated).
The menu on the tablet should always be visible.

Mandatory conditions for development:
● The project must be created without using third-party libraries, only the native code.
● The project must be adapted to various screen sizes, orientations and work on Android 4 and later versions.
● The project must include phone and tablet versions.
